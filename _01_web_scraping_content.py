## Introduction to Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites. 
It allows for the collection of specific data from web pages and can be used for various purposes 
like data analysis, automated testing, and data gathering for machine learning projects.

## Tools for Web Scraping

The most commonly used tools for web scraping in Python are BeautifulSoup and Scrapy. 
- **BeautifulSoup** is great for small-scale scraping and can handle different types of parsers.
- **Scrapy** is more powerful and provides a complete framework for large-scale web scraping.

## Basic Concepts

- **HTML Parsing:** Understanding the structure of the website's HTML.
- **Selector Gadget:** A tool to find the CSS selectors for desired data on a webpage.
- **Handling Pagination:** Scraping data from multiple pages.
- **Dynamic Content:** Dealing with JavaScript-loaded content.

## Simple Example

Here's a basic example using BeautifulSoup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = 'https://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find data within the page
data = soup.find_all('tag_name', {'class': 'class_name'})
for item in data:
    print(item.get_text())
```

This script fetches the content of 'https://example.com', parses it, and prints the text of specified elements.
